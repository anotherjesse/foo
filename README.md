# Personal Website

A personal website created using static HTML and Tailwind CSS framework. This website is a simple, modern, and responsive site that can be customized to showcase your personal projects, portfolio, and other information.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up and run the personal website:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-website.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd personal-website`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox)

## Tailwind CSS

The website uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for styling. It is easy to customize and extend, allowing you to create unique designs with minimal changes to the HTML structure.

### CDN

The project utilizes Tailwind CSS via a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This makes it easier to get started without the need to install or configure anything. To update the Tailwind CSS version, replace the link in the `index.html` file.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@latest/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Customization

To customize Tailwind CSS, you can either modify the utility classes directly in the HTML or extend the framework by creating a custom configuration file. To learn more about customizing Tailwind CSS, visit [the official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).
